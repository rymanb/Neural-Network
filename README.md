## About The Project

Simple C++ Neural Network utilizing gradient descent built from scratch. that is trained on the mnist data set to recognize handwritten numbers. The GUI is built using SDL2 and gives a visualization of the network. There is also the ability to draw your own numbers and the network will show you what it believes it is from 0-9 in the final network layer. It also can save previously trained network data for reloading later.
